# Pong Game Design Document

## 1. Game Overview
### 1.1 Game Concept
Pong is a classic 2D arcade game simulating table tennis. Two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

### 1.2 Genre
Arcade, Sports Simulation

### 1.3 Target Audience
All ages, casual gamers, fans of retro and competitive games.

### 1.4 Platform
Web-based (HTML5/JavaScript), playable on browsers for desktop and mobile devices.

### 1.5 Unique Selling Points
- Simple, intuitive gameplay with timeless appeal.
- Competitive multiplayer mode (local 2-player).
- Retro aesthetic with customizable modern visual options.
- Cross-platform accessibility via web browsers.

## 2. Gameplay
### 2.1 Objective
Players aim to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The first player to reach a set score (e.g., 11) wins the match.

### 2.2 Core Mechanics
- **Paddle Movement**: Each player controls a paddle that moves vertically along their side of the screen.
- **Ball Physics**: The ball bounces off paddles and screen edges, with angle and speed influenced by where it hits the paddle.
- **Scoring**: A point is scored when the ball passes the opponent's paddle and exits their side of the screen.
- **Serve**: After a point, the ball is served from the center toward the scoring player's side.

### 2.3 Controls
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle)**:
  - Up: W key
  - Down: S key
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle)**:
  - Up: Arrow Up key
  - Down: Arrow Down key
- **Start/Pause**: Spacebar
- **Menu Navigation**: Mouse or Enter key

### 2.4 Game Modes
- **Single Match**: Play until one player reaches 11 points.
- **AI Mode**: Single-player mode against a computer-controlled opponent with adjustable difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Practice Mode**: Single-player mode with no scoring, for practicing paddle control.

## 3. Game World
### 3.1 Setting
A minimalist, retro-style court resembling a table tennis table, with a black background, white dividing line, and simple geometric shapes for paddles and ball.

### 3.2 Visual Style
- **Retro Theme**: Default pixelated, monochromatic design (white elements on black background).
- **Modern Theme**: Optional colorful, sleek design with gradient backgrounds and glowing effects.
- **Customizable**: Players can toggle between themes and adjust colors via settings.

### 3.3 Audio
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Paddle hit: Short, sharp "beep" sound.
  - Wall hit: Softer "tick" sound.
  - Score: Distinct "ding" sound.
- **Background Music**: Optional looping chiptune track for retro feel, toggleable in settings.

## 4. User Interface
### 4.1 Main Menu
- **Play**: Start a new game (Single Match, AI Mode, Practice Mode).
- **Settings**: Adjust theme, sound volume, AI difficulty, and score limit.
- **Instructions**: Display control scheme and basic rules.
- **Exit**: Close the game (browser tab).

### 4.2 In-Game HUD
- **Score Display**: Player 1 and Player 2 scores at the top corners of the screen.
- **Pause Indicator**: Centered "Paused" text when game is paused.
- **Win Screen**: Displays "Player 1 Wins!" or "Player 2 Wins!" with option to restart or return to menu.

### 4.3 Settings Menu
- **Theme**: Retro or Modern.
- **Sound**: Music and SFX volume sliders (0-100%).
- **AI Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, Hard (for AI Mode).
- **Score Limit**: Adjustable from 5 to 21 points.

## 5. Technical Specifications
### 5.1 Technology
- **Language**: HTML5, JavaScript (using p5.js for rendering and physics).
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based 2D graphics.
- **Input**: Keyboard for paddle controls, mouse for menu navigation.

### 5.2 Game Loop
- **Update**: Handle paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, and scoring.
- **Render**: Draw paddles, ball, court, and HUD elements.
- **Frame Rate**: Target 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.

### 5.3 Physics
- **Ball Movement**: Constant speed with angle changes based on paddle hit position.
- **Collision Detection**: Rectangle-circle collision for paddles and ball, edge detection for walls.
- **Paddle Constraints**: Paddles cannot move beyond top/bottom screen edges.

### 5.4 AI Behavior
- **Easy**: AI tracks ball with delayed reaction and limited speed.
- **Medium**: AI tracks ball accurately with moderate speed.
- **Hard**: AI predicts ball trajectory with high accuracy and speed.

## 6. Development Plan
### 6.1 Milestones
- **Prototype (Week 1-2)**: Basic paddle movement, ball physics, and collision detection.
- **Core Gameplay (Week 3-4)**: Scoring, serve mechanics, and game loop completion.
- **Polish (Week 5-6)**: Add menus, themes, sound effects, and AI mode.
- **Testing (Week 7)**: Bug fixes, balance AI difficulty, and optimize performance.
- **Release (Week 8)**: Deploy to web platform and gather player feedback.

### 6.2 Tools
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code.
- **Graphics**: p5.js for rendering, optional sprite sheets for custom themes.
- **Audio**: Free chiptune sound libraries (e.g., OpenGameArt).
- **Testing**: Browser developer tools for debugging and performance testing.

## 7. Monetization
- **Free to Play**: No cost to access the game.
- **Optional Donations**: Include a donation link for supporting development.
- **Future Consideration**: Cosmetic DLC (e.g., additional themes or sound packs) via in-game store.

## 8. Post-Launch Support
- **Updates**: Regular bug fixes and performance improvements.
- **Community Feedback**: Monitor player suggestions for new features (e.g., online multiplayer).
- **Leaderboards**: Potential addition of local high-score tracking.
